- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - Sassy Cascading Style Sheets

### What I learned

This was my very first project where I used the API, I don't know how correct everything is, the main thing is that it works :D.

I used an **Import** Statement.
So I learned how to set a **type** attribute on the script in HTML file.


```html
<head>
  <script src="./assets/script/script.js" type="module"></script>
</head>
```
and Then how to import **data** to ./assets/script/script.js
```js
import data from '../data/data.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

### Continued development

First I want to finish the javascript course I'm taking on freecodecamp, I'm also going through the learning path on Frontendmentor, and after that I want to focus more on React, Next.js and Node.js.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - He is my hero, if I need something fast, if I can't understand something, or if I can't find it on the internet, I always ask him.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is my favorite documentation platform I've been using since I started programming, it's the best explained resource.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I'm always looking for news and listening to other developers, sharing their experiences so that I can see many different solutions to a problem. look back on this project in the future.**
